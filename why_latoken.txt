Why LATOKEN?
A springboard to the global market with technology and a culture of achievement, remotely

At Latoken, we help launch and buy the startups of the future. This helps entrepreneurs get support and investors to earn. We align short-term selfish interests of people with long-term collective prosperity. Investors do not vote for wars or injustice that erases the value of their trading accounts. If Latoken cannot democratize capital markets, billions of people may remain disconnected from the opportunities to participate in creating the future and earning from it, leading to increased inequality, division, and ultimately jeopardizing collective prosperity.

We will need to learn how to list the best tokens first and make them liquid and easily understandable for trading. To achieve this, we use AI, automating and scaling sales, as well as enriching token information with on-chain and social data.

Most importantly, we are building a team capable of this. We believe that AI will learn to code, so character is more important than development skills.

“No Company for Coders. Salesforce won’t Hire Engineers, Thanks to AI Gains”

CEO Benioff says freeze this year due to productivity gains of 30% with AI tools.

SURROUND YOURSELF WITH THOSE BORN TO CHANGE THE WORLD

Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov, coach of 18 world champions in sambo:
“My son’s friends stopped developing... I told my son, ‘They are not your friends, son.’ Khabib countered that they had been friends since school. I asked: Are they ready to do the volumes you do? — No. Do their parents think the same way I do? — No. — How can you walk the path together then?”

Slide 7:
CHARACTER

CHAMPION (Good)

Extra effort and responsibility to solve problems when most give up

Stress and pressure to accelerate and foster creativity

“Tortures” colleagues to perfection

Directness in discussing problems and mistakes, shortcomings

Technologies to create the future, not polish the past

VS.

ORDINARY PERSON (Bad)

Wants a “dust-free” job and looks for “side jobs”

Changes jobs when faced with difficulties and responsibility

Covers for colleagues so they cover for them

Nurtures grievances or gossips to justify slacking

Clings to rituals and habits

Slide 8:
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR DELIVERING VALUE TO CLIENTS

Bad:

“I’m not a manager, let someone else define my tasks.”

“This doesn’t depend on me.”

“I’m not QA, I shouldn’t test this.”

“I’m not an analyst, I shouldn’t check how the release affected conversion.”

“My workday is over.”

“Engage in ordinary rituals instead of hackathons on weekends.”

Good:

“I’ll figure it out and do it, outlining the project, tasks, blockers, and reports.”

“Demo or die - every week I push to deliver results in production and test.”

“I measure the value my work brings.”

“I’ll finish the task today so I don’t clutter tomorrow with unfinished work.”

“I find 10x improvements at hackathons on Saturdays.”

Slide 9:
CULTURE OF SPORTS ACHIEVEMENTS - WHY STARTUPS WIN

Mark Andreessen, Partner at one of the largest VC funds, a16z:
Startups find it easier to make teams more transparent and accountable due to their smaller size, options, and supportive processes. This attracts those who grow to change the world and repels freeloaders.

Slide 10:
STARTUP CULTURE - DEFINED BY THE THREAT OF DEATH IN THE ATTEMPT TO CREATE THE FUTURE

Ben Horowitz, Partner at one of the largest VC funds, a16z:
Wartime CEO

Creates and captures markets

Under constant threat of death

Swears and yells

Intolerant of defocus

Trains the team so they don’t get shot in the back

Slide 11:
CULTURE
FULL COMMITMENT TO GROW TO BE MORE USEFUL, "BALANCE" AND "HAPPINESS" ARE NOT FOR CHAMPIONS

Mark Andreessen, Partner at one of the largest VC funds, a16z:

Happiness is not the goal, but a treat like ice cream. The goal is to be useful to people.

There is no balance, only a life where you learn to be more useful. Choosing between a date or a hackathon on Saturday depends on where you will grow more.

Stress is a friend that helps overcome obstacles.

No side, pet, or personal projects. Full commitment.

Slide 12:
CORE PRINCIPLES - THE THREAT OF SURVIVAL FOR GROWTH

Clients first, ego last

“Torture” to perfection
